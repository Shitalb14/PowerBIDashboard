## **Key Features**

### **Data Loading & Transformation (Power Query)**

- **Power Query** is used to import, clean, and transform data for analysis.
- Key operations like data type conversions, data aggregation, filtering, and joining are performed to ensure the data is ready for modeling.

### **Data Model**

- **Star Schema**: A well-organized data model using fact and dimension tables.
- **Relationships**: Proper relationships between tables are created using primary and foreign keys to ensure efficient querying.
- **Calculated Measures**: Created using DAX to provide custom metrics like sales growth, profit margins, etc.

### **Visualizations**

- **Bar/Column Charts**: Display sales and performance metrics across different categories.
- **Line/Area Charts**: Track trends over time (e.g., sales growth, revenue).
- **Pie/Donut Charts**: Show percentage breakdowns of data (e.g., regional sales distribution).
- **KPI Visuals**: Display key performance indicators with color-coding (green for on target, red for below target).
- **Treemaps & Maps**: Visualize hierarchical data and geographical performance.
- **Tables/Matrix**: Provide detailed reports for deeper analysis.

### **DAX Calculations**

- **Calculated Measures**: Custom DAX formulas used to calculate metrics such as year-over-year growth and customer retention.
- **Time Intelligence**: Functions used to compute cumulative totals, YTD, and period-over-period comparisons.
- **Dynamic Measures**: Measures that respond to slicers and filters, providing a flexible user experience.

### **Power BI Service Features**

- **Row-level Security (RLS)**: Restricts data access based on user roles, ensuring sensitive information is only visible to authorized users.
- **Scheduled Refresh**: Data is automatically refreshed to keep the reports up-to-date.
- **Sharing & Collaboration**: Reports are shared via Power BI Service, enabling collaboration and feedback.
- **Subscriptions**: Stakeholders can subscribe to receive regular email updates on key metrics.

## **Visual Design**

- **Layout**: The dashboard is designed to be user-friendly and responsive, with a clean, modern design.
- **Color Scheme**: Consistent colors are used to ensure readability and to align with the company’s branding.
- **Navigation**: Clear navigation is provided through slicers, bookmarks, and drill-through capabilities to allow users to explore data interactively.
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Optimized for mobile and tablet viewing to ensure accessibility on any device.

## **Installation**

1. **Power BI Desktop**: 
   - Download and install [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/) if you haven’t already.
2. **Download the PBIX File**: 
   - Download the project file **[ProjectName].pbix** and open it in Power BI Desktop.
3. **Connect Data Sources**:
   - Make sure the necessary data sources (e.g., SQL Server, Excel files) are connected properly and have the appropriate credentials.
4. **Publish to Power BI Service**:
   - Once your reports are ready, publish them to the Power BI Service to share with others and enable scheduled refresh.
